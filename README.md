# Banking Predictions with Logistic Regression üìäü§ñ

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a client subscribes to a term deposit in a banking dataset. The dataset includes various customer attributes, such as job, marital status, education, and financial information. The goal is to predict the target variable, `y`, which indicates if the client subscribed to a term deposit ("yes" or "no").

## Project Overview üñ•Ô∏è

The project performs several key steps, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Here is a breakdown of the process:

### 1. Import Data

The data is imported from a CSV file using pandas. The dataset includes several features related to customer information and their interaction with a bank marketing campaign.

### 2. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets

The dataset is split into a training set (75%) and a testing set (25%) using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.

### 3. Data Cleaning

- The target variable `y` is converted into a binary format (0 for "no" and 1 for "yes").
- Categorical variables, such as `default` and `education`, are also converted into binary or simplified categories. 
- Dummy variables are created for categorical features using `pd.get_dummies`, ensuring that all categorical variables are properly encoded.

### 4. Feature Selection

Using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), the model selects the most relevant features for prediction. The top 12 features are selected to avoid overfitting and enhance the model's performance.

### 5. Model Creation

A Logistic Regression model is trained using the selected features from the training set. The model is fit using the `fit` method of the `LogisticRegression` class from `sklearn.linear_model`.

### 6. Model Validation

The trained model is validated using the test set. The predicted labels (`y_pred`) are compared against the actual labels (`y_test`), and probabilities (`y_pred_proba`) are also computed to assess the model‚Äôs performance.

### 7. Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is generated to evaluate the model's classification performance. The following metrics are calculated from the matrix:
- **Accuracy**: The overall correctness of the model.
- **Sensitivity (Recall)**: The proportion of actual positives correctly identified by the model.
- **Specificity**: The proportion of actual negatives correctly identified by the model.

### 8. ROC Curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve)

The model's performance is further assessed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve plots sensitivity against 1-specificity for various thresholds. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) score is also computed to summarize the model's ability to distinguish between the classes.

### Results
- **Accuracy**: 91%
- **Sensitivity**: 19%
- **Specificity**: 97%
- **AUC Score**: 0.78

## Conclusion ‚ú®

This project demonstrates how to build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression to predict customer behavior based on historical data. The model achieved a high accuracy but has room for improvement, particularly in increasing sensitivity. Further exploration with different models or feature engineering could enhance the predictive power.
